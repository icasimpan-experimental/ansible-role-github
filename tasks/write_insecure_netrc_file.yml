- name: Put an insecure netrc file on disk becase some tools are poorly written and don't support git over ssh.  I don't like doing this.  If you have a better idea (I couldn't get git credential helpers to work appropriately), please implement it.
  template:
    src: .net.rc.j2
    dest: "/home/{{ git_user }}/.netrc"
    owner: "{{ git_user }}"
    group: "{{ git_user }}"
    mode: 0600
